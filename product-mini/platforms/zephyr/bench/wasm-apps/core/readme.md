# Benchmark core

>üìÑ **Notes:** The result presented here are outdated, because we choose to change benchmark build. But they can still provide an insight of wasm / zephyr performance.

## Different cases
To run these benchmark we can distinguish four cases:

1. **Case 1:** Zephyr and wasm module are not optimized.
    * **`prj.conf`:** Ensure that `CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=y` is set.
    * **module compilation:** Use the provided compilation command.

2. **Case 2:** Zephyr is optimized and wasm module is not optimized.
    * **`prj.conf`:** Ensure that `CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=n` is set, or by default it is set to `n`.
    * **module compilation:**  Use the provided compilation command.

3. **Case 3:** Zephyr is not optimized and wasm module is optimized.
    * **`prj.conf`:** Ensure that `CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=y` is set.
    * **module compilation:**  Use the provided compilation command, but add `-O3`, `-flto` and `Wl,--lto-O3` flag to the command.

4. **Case 4:** Zephyr and wasm module are optimized.
    * **`prj.conf`:** Ensure that `CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=y` is set.
    * **module compilation:**  Use the provided compilation command, but add `-O3`, `-flto` and `Wl,--lto-O3` flag to the command.

## Ackermann benchmark
### Description
The Ackermann function is a classic example of a recursive function, which is a function that calls itself.

* **Nature:** The Ackermann function is a non-primitive recursive function that grows very rapidly. It's more complex than the Fibonacci sequence and can push the limits of a system's recursion stack.

* **Focus:** This benchmark is more about testing the limits of recursion depth and the efficiency of handling deeply recursive calls. It's less about arithmetic operations and more about recursion and stack management.

* **Usefulness:** It's used to test the system's capability to manage complex recursive calls and stack depth, which can be critical for certain types of applications.

### Compilation
The default compilation command for the Ackermann function is:
```bash
~/wasi-sdk-21.0/bin/clang --sysroot=/home/user/wasi-sdk-21.0/share/wasi-sysroot -nodefaultlibs -o wasm-apps/ackermann.wasm wasm-apps/ackermann.c -z stack-size=8192 -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export=__heap_base -Wl,--export=__data_end -Wl,--allow-undefined -Wl,--export=main
```
* **--allow-undefined** To prevent error for undefined symbols `printf`, `bench_start` and `bench_end`. 
    * `printf` provided by the runtime `lib-builtin`.
    * `bench_start` and `bench_end` are provided by passing native symbols to the runtime in the `main` implementation.
* **-z stack-size=8192 -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export=__heap_base -Wl,--export=__data_end** Are usual symbols when compiling a wasm module to be run on a restricted environment.
* **-nodefaultlibs** To prevent the default linking of the standard C library. Binary will be lighter and we will not call WASI functions (`printf` call `__wasi_fd_write`).

### Measurement
We measure the time taken to calculate the Ackermann function for:
* `M` = [1, 2, 3]
* `N` = [0, ..., 9] and for `M`=3 we stop when wasm overflows.

Then we calculate the sum of the CPU ticks for each case and compare the results.

| case | native sum | wasm sum | wasm / native  |
| :--: | ---------: | -------: | :------------: | 
| 1 | 19053,6 | 1424013,76 | 252,597572 |
| 2 | 1872,48 | 477242,84 | 254,8720627 |
| 3 | 19053,6 | 823645,16 | 43,22779737 |
| 4 | 5996,30| 242327,9 | 40,41286304 |

> üìÑ **Notes:** The 3th and 4th case were actually performed on one more value of `n`.

```

### Measurement
We performed different measure by changing the number of iterations of the function.

The limit was fixed at 10000 iterations. If the code managed to get here we stopped the execution. Else we stopped where the overflow occured with a variation of ¬± 100 iterations.

* **case 1:** stopped at 900 with 10 measurements

* **case 3:** reached 10000 with 27 measurements
* **case 4:** reached 10000 with 10 measurements

> üìÑ **Notes:**  `SIZE` = 5 is the minimum size possible due to the implementation.

* **case 1:** stopped at `LENGTH` = 1000.
* **case 2:** stopped at `LENGTH` = 1000. 

Then we calculate the sum of the CPU ticks for each case and compare the results.

| case | native sum | wasm sum | wasm / native  |

* **Usefulness:** It's valuable for evaluating the efficiency of memory copy operations and the performance of handling large datasets. This benchmark is essential for applications that require efficient memory management and data handling.

### Compilation
The default compilation command for the Memory Move benchmark is:
```bash
~/wasi-sdk-21.0/bin/clang --sysroot=/home/user/wasi-sdk-21.0/share/wasi-sysroot -nodefaultlibs -o wasm-apps/memmove.wasm wasm-apps/memmove.c -z stack-size=8192 -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export=__heap_base -Wl,--export=__data_end -Wl,--allow-undefined -Wl,--export=main

To not have too many measurements we fix a parameter when measuring the other.
* When measuring  `STR_SIZE` we set `ITERATIONS` = 1.
* When measuring `ITERATIONS` we set `STR_SIZE` = 10.

> üìÑ **Notes:** We couldn't try `STR_SIZE` = 100000 because of the runtime is not configurated to have so much bytes allocated.
>```bash
>[00:00:00:000 - 20001790]: warning: allocate 100000 bytes memory failed
>```

Then we calculate the sum of the CPU ticks for each case and compare the results.

In this case we can't establish a table comparison between the native and wasm code.

    * **case 4:** 1,044094462
* **Observation 2:** The more `ITERATIONS` grow the more precise we are on the measurement, but we couldn't apply a lot of iterations to big values of `STR_SIZE` because of the timer overflow.

| 4 | 24453582 | 460560896 | 18,83408721 |

```

### Measurement

* **case 1:** stopped at `LENGTH` = 8.

Then we calculate the sum of the CPU ticks for each case and compare the results.

>‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** The measurement showed that this case was not fair because the optimized wasm code seem to benefit from loop optimization. It is probably due to the fact that the wasm code is compiled with `-O3` and the native code is not.

* **Usefulness:** It's valuable for evaluating the efficiency of Base64 encoding and decoding operations and the performance of handling data conversion tasks. This benchmark is essential for applications that require efficient handling of data conversion operations.

### Compilation

~/wasi-sdk-21.0/bin/clang --sysroot=/home/user/wasi-sdk-21.0/share/wasi-sysroot -nodefaultlibs -o wasm-apps/base64.wasm wasm-apps/base64.c -z stack-size=8192 -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export=__heap_base -Wl,--export=__data_end -Wl,--allow-undefined -Wl,--export=main
```

### Measurement

* `ITERATIONS` = [1, ..., 1000] with `ITERATIONS` *= 10

To not have too many measurements we fix a parameter when measuring the other.
* When measuring  `LENGTH` we set `ITERATIONS` = 1.
* When measuring `ITERATIONS` we set `LENGTH` = 10.

</br>

* **case 4:** only one measurement at `LENGTH` = 10000.

Then we calculate the sum of the CPU ticks for each case and compare the results. We can't establish a table comparison between the native and wasm code.

We will only give the result of `ITERATIONS` = 1000 and set `LENGTH` = 10, which is the most precise measurememnt. 

| case | native | wasm | wasm / native  |
| :--: | ---------: | -------: | :------------: | 
| 1 | 4161615 | 1543660783 | 370,9283014 |

| 4 | 2000432 | 104465357 | 52,22139868 |

> üìÑ **Notes:** This is likely not a real case as `LENGTH` = 10 seem too small, but due to timer constraint up to 2^32 ticks we can't set a higher value of `LENGTH` because it will reduce the `ITERATIONS` number. The measurement still give valuable insight of native and wasm performances.
